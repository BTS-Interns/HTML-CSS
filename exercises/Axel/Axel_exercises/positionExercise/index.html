                    I was born on a cold, dark nigth in November 27th in Cuernavaca, Morelos.
                    I still live in Morelos in a small town called Xochitepec, and I went to school at UAEM.
                    I live with my dad, Héctor; my brother, Dylan; my grand mother Tere; my dog Morrison and my cats Venus and Cecilia.
                    Also I have a sister called Angie but she lives with my mama in Cuernavaca.
                    Who I am in life.

                    My full name is Héctor Axel Nolasco López.
                    I studied computings sciences when I was 19 and I finished it in august of 2016.
                    I like to do code, play the guitar, read books, play football, see the NFL at TV, listen to music, watch movies, play video games and learn new things.
                    What's my outlook on the future.

                    In this moment I want to finish the interns program at BTS and continue learning lenguages and technologies.
                    I want to become a full stack developer and learn about data security.
                    Soon I will get the title of my carrer and I'll get a job out of this country 'cause I'd like to travel around the world and know new cultures.

                        I was born in Mexico City in September 1987 and grew up in Morelos; nowadays I live in Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco México which is crowded of beautiful ladies.

                        While leaving in Morelos, I studied Software Engineering at the UPEMOR and now I'm an intern at a very prestigious company, Blue Trail Software.

                        My family is really cool, my mom and dad are really young and I have a beautiful Biotechnology Engineer as a sister. I'm a single father of a gorgeous little kitten "Michita".

                        I really love what I do, I enjoy solving challenging problems and develop software.

                        There's a ton of things that I like and enjoy to do:

                        Listening to music. The electronic music is my favorite.
                        Watching TV Shows. The Flash, Arrow, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Friends, Sense 8.
                        Playing sports. I really like baseball, basketball, pool and bowling. I'm not a big fan of soccer.
                        Playing videogames: Gears of War, Mortal Kombat, Pokemon Go, Racing games.
                        Sleeping: I'll do it everyday if necessary.
