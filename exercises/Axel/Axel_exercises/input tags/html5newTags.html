        <h2>search tag</h2>
        <input type="search" name="search">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input type="search" name="search" ></code>
        <p>
            Desktop browsers will render this in a similar
            way to a standard text field—until you start typing, that is.
            At this point, a small cross appears on the right side of the field.
            This lets you quickly clear the field,
            just like Safari’s built-in search field.
            <br>
            As you’ve seen with the new attributes, browsers that
            don’t understand them will simply degrade gracefully.
            The same applies to all of the new input types discussed here.
            If a browser doesn’t understand type="search", it will default
            to type="text". This means you’re not losing anything.
            In fact, you’re using progressive enhancement and helping users
            to have a better experience. Let’s face it: filling out web forms
             isn’t very fun, so anything you can add to ensure a smoother experience, the better.

        <h2>email tag</h2>
        <input type="email" name="email">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input type="email" name="email" required ></code>
        <p>
            In rendering terms, the email input type is no different than
            a standard text input type and allows for one or more e-mail
            addresses to be entered. Combined with the required attribute,
            the browser is then able to look for patterns to ensure a valid
            e-mail address has been entered. Naturally, this checking is
            rudimentary, perhaps looking for an @ character or a period (.)
            And not allowing spaces. Opera 9.5+, Firefox 4+, Internet Explorer
            10 and Chrome 5+ have already implemented this basic validation.
            The browser goes as far as presenting the user with an error message
            if the e-mail address entered isn’t valid. You can style the field for when an value is entered using
            the :valid, :invalid or :required pseudo class
        </p>

        <h2>url tag</h2>
        <input type="url" name="url">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input type="url" name="url" ></code>
        <p>
            The url input type, as you might expect, is for web addresses.
            You can use the multiple attribute to enter more than one URL.
            Like type="email", a browser will carry out simple validation
            on these fields and present an error message on form submission.
            This is likely to include looking for forward slashes, periods,
            and spaces, and possibly detecting a valid top-level domain (such as .com or .co.uk).

        <h2>tel tag</h2>
        <input input type="tel" name="tel" id="tel">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input type="tel" name="tel" id="tel" ></code>
        <p>
            tel differs from email and url in that no particular
            syntax is enforced. Phone numbers differ around the world,
            making it difficult to guarantee any type of specific notation
            except for allowing only numbers and perhaps a + symbol to be entered.

        <h2>number tag</h2>
        <input type="number" min="5" max="18" step="0.5" value="9" name="shoe-size">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input type="number" min="5" max="18" step="0.5" value="9" name="shoe-size" ></code>
        <p>
            number, as you might expect, is used for specifying a numerical value.
            As with the majority of these new input types, Opera was the first to
            implement type="number". It, Safari, and Chrome render the input as a
            spinbox control whereby you can click the arrows to move
            up or down. Or if you prefer, you can type directly into the field.
            Firefox, on the other hand, renders the field like a standard text box.
            Support for type=”number” is in IE 10 also, although if you enter a
            non-numerical character the field empties when focus is lost and no
            feedback is provided to the user.
        </p>

        <h2>range tag</h2>
        <input id="skill" type="range" min="1" max="100" value="0">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input id="skill" type="range" min="1" max="100" value="0" ></code>
        <p>
            The range input type is similar to number but more specific.
            It represents a numerical value within a given range.
            Why the difference? Because when you’re using range, the exact value
            isn’t important. It also allows browsers to offer a simpler control than for number.
            In Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer 10 and Chrome, type="range" renders as a slider.
            When moving the slider in IE 10 a tooltip appears showing the current value.
            Additionally, in Opera, if the CSS defines the height greater than the width,
            the slider control will be rendered vertically as opposed to the standard horizontal rendering.

        <h2>date tag</h2>
        <input id="dob" name="dob" type="date">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input id="dob" name="dob" type="date" ></code>
        <p>
            If you’ve ever booked tickets online, you will have come across
            date pickers to help you quickly and easily choose the date
            you require. Perhaps you’ve even implemented a date picker on your
            own website. Generally, this is done using a JavaScript library
            such as jQuery, Dojo, or YUI. It can be a pain when you need to load
            a whole library and associated plug-ins just to implement a simple
            date picker. Well, with HTML5 we get that functionality baked into
            the browser. Not only that, but we don’t have to stop at just electing
            a single date; we can select a week, month, time, date and time,
            and even date and time with a time zone using the different input types.
            The markup is pretty straightforward.

            You can go a step further by using the min and max attributes to
            ensure the user can only choose from a specified date range.
            < input id="startdate" name="startdate" min="2012-01-01" max="2013-01-01" type="date" >
        </p>

        <h4>Month</h4>
        <input id="expiry" name="expiry" type="month" required>
        <h4>Week</h4>
        <input id="expiry" name="expiry" type="week" required>
        <h4>Time</h4>
        <input id="exit-time" name="exit-time" type="time">
        <h4>Datetime</h4>
        <input id="entry-day-time" name="entry-day-time" type="datetime">
        <h4>Datetime-local</h4>
        <input id="arrival-time" name="arrival-time " type="datetime-local">

        <h2>color tag</h2>
        <input id="color" name="color" type="color">
        <h3>the tag:</h3>
        <code>< input id="color" name="color" type="color" ></code>
        <p>
            The color input type is pretty self-explanatory: it allows
            the user to select a color and returns the hex value for that color.
            It is anticipated that users will either be able to type the value
            or select from a color picker, which will either be native to the
            operating system or a browser’s own implementation. Opera 11 has
            implemented type=”color” with a simple color picker that offers a
            number of standard color choices or the option to select Other,
            which brings up the operating system color picker.
