						I was born in Mexico City in September 1987 and grew up in Morelos; nowadays I live in Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco México which is crowded of beautiful ladies. While leaving in Morelos, I studied Software Engineering at the UPEMOR and now I'm an intern at a very prestigious company, Blue Trail Software. My family is really cool, my mom and dad are really young and I have a beautiful Biotechnology Engineer as a sister. I'm a single father of a gorgeous little kitten "Michita". I really love what I do, I enjoy solving challenging problems and develop software.

						Nací el 21 de noviembre de 1991 en Parral, Chihuahua y estudié en Ingeniería en Software en la UACH. De grande quiero ser graffitera como Banksy. Me sé muchos nombres modelos pero hasta ahorita no me ha servido para nada. Me molesta mucho que no haya un emoji con cabello rizado.
