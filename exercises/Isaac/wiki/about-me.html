			<p>I was born in Mexico City in September 1987 and grew up in Morelos; nowadays I live in Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco México which is crowded of beautiful ladies.</p>
			<p>While leaving in Morelos, I studied Software Engineering at the UPEMOR and now I'm an intern at a very prestigious company, Blue Trail Software.</p>
			<p>My family is really cool, my mom and dad are really young and I have a beautiful Biotechnology Engineer as a sister. I'm a single father of a gorgeous little kitten "Michita".</p>
			<p>I really love what I do, I enjoy solving challenging problems and develop software.</p>
			<p>There's a ton of things that I like and enjoy to do:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Listening to music. The electronic music is my favorite.</li>
				<li>Watching TV Shows. The Flash, Arrow, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Friends, Sense 8.</li>
				<li>Playing sports. I really like baseball, basketball, pool and bowling. I'm not a big fan of soccer.</li>
				<li>Playing videogames: Gears of War, Mortal Kombat, Pokemon Go, Racing games.</li>
				<li>Sleeping: I'll do it everyday if necessary.</li>
			</ul>
