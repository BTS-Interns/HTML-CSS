                    and my cats Venus and Cecilia.
                    Also I have a sister called Angie but she lives
                    with my mama in Cuernavaca.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My full name is Héctor Axel Nolasco López.
                    I studied computings sciences when I was
                    19 and I finished it in august of 2016.
                    I like to do code, play the guitar, read books, play football, see the
                    NFL at TV, listen to music, watch movies, play video games and learn new things.

                    What's my outlook on the future.
                    In this moment I want to finish the interns program at BTS and continue learning
                    lenguages and technologies.
                    I want to become a full stack developer and
                    learn about data security.
                    Soon I will get the title of my carrer and I'll get
                     a job out of this country 'cause I'd like to travel around the world and
