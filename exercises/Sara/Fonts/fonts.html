  <h3>Banksy</h3>
  <p>Imagine a city where graffiti wasn't illegal, a city where everybody could draw whatever they liked.
    Where every street was awash with a million colours and little phrases.
    Where standing at a bus stop was never boring.
    A city that felt like a party where everyone was invited, not just the estate agents and barons of big business.
    Imagine a city like that and stop leaning against the wall - it's wet.</p>
  <h3>Kate Moss</h3>
    <p>Kate Moss (born 16 January, 1974)[3] is an English model. Born in Croydon, Greater London, she was discovered in 1988 at age 14 by Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Model Management, at JFK Airport in New York City.
    Arriving at the end of the "supermodel era", Moss rose to fame in the early 1990s as part of the heroin chic fashion trend. Her collaborations with Calvin Klein brought her to fashion icon status. She is known for her waifish figure, and role in size zero fashion.
    She received an award at the 2013 British Fashion Awards to acknowledge her contribution to fashion over 25 years. Moss is also a contributing fashion editor for British Vogue.
    Moss has had her own clothing range and has been involved in musical projects. She has won accolades for modelling. In 2007, TIME named her one of the world's 100 most influential people.[4]
    She has inspired cultural depictions including a £1.5m ($2.8m) 18 carat gold statue of her, sculpted in 2008 for a British Museum exhibition.[5]
    She began dating Jefferson Hack in the early 2000s and they have a daughter. She later dated musician Pete Doherty. She is married to Jamie Hince, guitarist for the Kills. She received media scrutiny for her party lifestyle and drug use.
    Drug allegations beginning in late 2005 led to her being dropped from fashion campaigns.[6]
    She was cleared of charges and resumed modelling.
    In 2012, she came second on the Forbes top-earning models list, with estimated earnings of $9.2 million in one year.[7]</p>
