    “Imagine a city where graffiti wasn't illegal, a city where everybody could draw whatever they liked.
    Where every street was awash with a million colours and little phrases.
    Where standing at a bus stop was never boring. A city that felt like a party where everyone was invited, not just the estate agents and barons of big business.
    Imagine a city like that and stop leaning against the wall - it's wet.”
