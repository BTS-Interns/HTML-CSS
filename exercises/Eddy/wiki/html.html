				<h1 id = "html">HTML</h1>
				<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies
				   webpage structure.
				
				   Brief history
				   In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the
				   concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through
				   a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally specifying HTML in
				   1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994
				   Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over
				   the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 Recommendation a year later. HTML
				   4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.
				
				   At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the
				   founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG,
				   work on HTML5 continued: the two organizations released the first draft in
				   2008 and the final standard in 2014.
				
				   Concept and syntax
				   An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements
				   are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends
				   with angle brackets (<>). There are a few empty or void tags that cannot
				   enclose any text, for instance < img >.
				
				   You can extend HTML tags with attributes, which provide additional
				   information affecting how the browser interprets the element:</p>
				<div class = "row">
					<div class = "col-xs-12">
						<h2 id = "a1">< a ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Anchor Element (< a >) defines a hyperlink to a location on the
						   same page or any other page on the Web. It can also be used (in an
						   obsolete way) to create an anchor pointâ€”a destination for hyperlinks
						   within the content of a page, so that links aren't limited to connecting
						   simply to the top of a page.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a2">< abbr ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < abbr > element (or HTML Abbreviation Element) represents an
						   abbreviation and optionally provides a full description for it. If
						   present, the title attribute must contain this full description and
						   nothing else.
						</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a4">< address ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < address > element supplies contact information for its
						   near</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a6">< area ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < area > element defines a hot-spot region on an image, and
						   optionally associates it with a hypertext link. This element is used only
						   within a < map > element.n</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a7">< article ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < article > element represents a self-contained composition in a
						   document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be
						   independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). This
						   could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an
						   object, or any other independent item of content. Each < article > should
						   be identified, typically by including a heading (< h1 >-< h6 > element)
						   as a child of the < article > element.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a8">< aside ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < aside > element represents a section of the page with content
						   connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate
						   from that content. These sections are often represented as sidebars or
						   inserts. They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as
						   definitions from the glossary; there may also be other types of
						   information, such as related advertisements; the biography of the author;
						   web applications; profile information or related links on the blog.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a9">< audio ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < audio > element is used to embed sound content in documents.
						   It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src
						   attribute or the < source > element; the browser will choose the most
						   suitable one.
						
						   Fallback content for browsers not supporting the < audio element can be
						   added too, inside the opening and closing < audio >< /audio > tags.
						
						   The most basic playback functionality can be made available using the
						   controls attribute (see below); for more advanced usage, audio playback
						   and controls can be manipulated using the HTML Media API, and more
						   specifically the features defined in the HTMLAudioElement interface.
						
						   You can also use the Web Audio API to directly generate and manipulate
						   audio streams from JavaScript code. See Web Audio API for details.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a10">< b ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < b > Element represents a span of text stylistically different
						   from normal text, without conveying any special importance
						   or relevance. It is typically used for keywords in a
						   summary, product names in a review, or other spans of text
						   whose typical presentation would be boldfaced. Another
						   example of its use is to mark the lead sentence of each
						   paragraph of an article.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a11">< base ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < base > element specifies the base URL to use for all relative
						   URLs contained within a document. There can be only one < base > element
						   in a document.
						
						   The base URL of a document can be queried from a script using
						   document.baseURI.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a13">< bdi ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < bdi > Element (or Bi-Directional Isolation Element) isolates a
						   span of
						   text that might be formatted in a different direction from other
						   text outside it.
						   This element is useful when embedding text with an unknown
						   directionality, from a database for example, inside text with a
						   fixed directionality.
						</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a14">< bdo ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < bdo > Element (or HTML bidirectional override element) is used
						   to override the current directionality of text. It causes
						   the directionality of the characters to be ignored in
						   favor of the specified directionality.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a18">< blockquote ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a19">< body></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a20">< br ></h2>
						<p>The HTML element line break < br > produces a line break in text
						   (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where
						   the division of lines is significant.
						   Do not use < br > to increase the gap between lines of text; use the CSS
						   margin property or the < p > element.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a21">< button> </h2>
						<p>The HTML < button > Element represents a clickable button.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a22">< canvas ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < canvas > Element can be used to draw graphics via scripting
						   (usually JavaScript). For example, it can be used to draw graphs, make
						   photo compositions or even perform animations. You may (and should)
						   provide alternate content inside the < canvas > block. That content will
						   be rendered both on older browsers that don't support canvas and in
						   browsers with JavaScript disabled.
						
						   For more articles on canvas, see the canvas topic page.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a23">< caption > </h2>
						<p>The HTML < caption > Element (or HTML Table Caption Element) represents
						   the title of a table. Though it is always the first descendant of a <
						   table >, its styling, using CSS, may place it elsewhere, relative to the
						   table.</p>
						
						
						<h2 id = "a25">< cite ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Citation Element (< cite >) represents a reference to a creative
						   work. It must include the title of a work or a URL reference, which may
						   be in an abbreviate</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a26">< code ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Code Element (< code >) represents a fragment of computer code.
						   By default, it is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a27">< col ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Table Column Element (< col >) defines a column within a table
						   and is used for defining common semantics on all common cells. It is
						   generally found within a < colgroup > element.
						   This element allows styling columns using CSS, but only a few attributes
						   will have an effect on the column (see the CSS 2.1 specification for a
						   list).</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a28">< colgroup ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Table Column Group Element (< colgroup >) defines a group of columns within a table.</p>
						
						
						<h2 id = "a30">< content ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < content > element is used inside of Shadow DOM as an insertion point. It is not intended to be used in ordinary HTML. It is used with Web Components. It has now been replaced by the < slot > element.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a31">< data ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < data > Element links a given content with a machine-readable
						   translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the < time > must
						   be used.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a32">< datalist ></h2>

						<h2 id = "a42">< element ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a43">< em ></h2>
						<p>The HTML element emphasis < em > marks text that has stress emphasis. The
						   < em > element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a
						   greater degree of emphasis.</p>

						<h2 id = "a97">< q ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Quote Element (< q >) indicates that the enclosed text is a
						   short inline quotation. This element is intended for short quotations
						   that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use < blockquote
						   > element.</p>
						<h2 id = "a98">< rp ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < rp > element is used to provide fall-back parenthesis for
						   browsers non-supporting ruby annotations. Ruby annotations are for
						   showing pronunciation of East Asian characters, like using Japanese
						   furigana or Taiwainese bopomofo characters. The < rp > element is used in
						   the case of lack of < ruby > element support its content has what should
						   be displayed in order to indicate the presence of a ruby annotation,
						   usually parentheses.</p>
						<h2 id = "a99">< rt ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < rt > Element embraces pronunciation of characters presented in
						   a ruby annotations, which are used to describe the pronunciation of East
						   Asian characters. This element is always used inside a < ruby >
						   element.</p>
						<h2 id = "a100">< rtc ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < rtc > Element embraces semantic annotations of characters
						   presented in a ruby of < rb > elements used inside of < ruby > element. <
						   rb > elements can have both pronunciation (< rt >) and semantic (< rtc >)
						   annotations.</p>
						<h2 id = "a101">< ruby ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < ruby > Element represents a ruby annotation. Ruby annotations
						   are for showing pronunciation of East Asian characters.</p>
						<h2 id = "a102">< s ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Strikethrough Element (< s >) renders text with a strikethrough,
						   or a line through it. Use the < s > element to represent things that are
						   no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, < s > is not
						   appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the < del > and
						   < ins > elements, as appropriate.</p>
						<h2 id = "a103">< samp ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < samp > element is an element intended to identify sample
						   output from a computer program. It is usually displayed in the browser's
						   default monotype font (such as Lucida Console).</p>
						<h2 id = "a104">< script ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a105">< section ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a106">< select ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a107">< shadow ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a108">< small ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Small Element (< small >) makes the text font size one size
						   smaller (for example, from large to medium, or from small to x-small)
						   down to the browser's minimum font size. In HTML5, this element is
						   repurposed to represent side-comments and small print, including
						   copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation.</p>
						<h2 id = "a109">< source ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a110">< spacer ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a111">< span ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < span > element is a generic inline container for phrasing
						   content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to
						   group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes),
						   or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used
						   only when no other semantic element is appropriate. < span > is very much
						   like a < div > element, but < div > is a block-level element whereas a <
						   span > is an inline element.</p>
						<h2 id = "a112">< strike ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a113">< strong ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Strong Element (< strong >) gives text strong importance, and is
						   typically displayed in bold.</p>
						<h2 id = "a114">< style ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a115">< sub ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Subscript Element (< sub >) defines a span of text that should
						   be displayed, for typographic reasoons, lower, and often smaller, than
						   the
						   main span of text.</p>
						<h2 id = "a116">< summary ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a117">< sup ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Superscript Element (< sup >) defines a span of text that should
						   be displayed, for typographic reasoons, higher, and often smaller, than
						   the main span of text.</p>
						<h2 id = "a118">< table ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a119">< tbody ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a120">< td ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a121">< template ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a122">< textarea ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a123">< tfoot ></h2>
						<p>We will have content here soon</p>
						<h2 id = "a124">< th ></h2>
						<p>The HTML element table header cell < th > defines a cell as header of a
						   group of table cells. The exact nature of this group is defined by the
						   scope and headers attributes.</p>
						<h2 id = "a125">< thead ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Table Head Element (< thead >) defines a set of rows defining
						   the head of the columns of the table.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a126">< time ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < time > element represents either a time on a 24-hour clock or
						   a precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone
						   information).
						
						   This element is intended to be used presenting dates and times in a
						   machine readable format. This can be helpful for user agents to offer any
						   event scheduling for user's calendar. </p>
						
						<h2 id = "a127">< title ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < title > element defines the title of the document, shown in a
						   browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text, and
						   any contained tags are ignored.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a128">< tr ></h2>
						<p>The HTML element table row < tr > defines a row of cells in a table.
						   Those can be a mix of < td > and < th > elements.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a129">< track ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < track > element is used as a child of the media elementsâ€”<
						   audio> and < video >. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or
						   time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The
						   tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) â€” Web Video Text
						   Tracks.
						
						   The type of data that track adds to the media is set in the kind
						   attribute, which can take values of subtitles, captions, descriptions,
						   chapters or metadata. The element points to a source file containing
						   timed text that the browser exposes when the user requests additional
						   data.
						
						   A media element cannot have more than one track with the same kind,
						   srclang, and label.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a131">< u ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Underline Element (< u >) renders text with an underline, a line
						   under the baseline of its content.
						
						   In HTML5, this element represents a span of text with an unarticulated,
						   though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labeling the
						   text as being a proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark),
						   or labeling the text as being misspelled.
						
						</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a132">< ul ></h2>
						<p>The HTML < ul > element (or HTML Unordered List Element) represents an
						   unordered list of items, namely a collection of items that do not have a
						   numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.
						   Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be
						   of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a squared. The bullet style is
						   not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated
						   CSS, using the list-style-type property.
						
						   There is no limitation to the depth and imbrication of lists defined with
						   the < ol > and < ul > elements.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a133">< var ></h2>
						<p>The HTML Variable Element (< var >) represents a variable in a
						   mathematical expression or a programming context.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a134">< video ></h2>
						<p>Use the HTML < video > element to embed video content in a document. The
						   video element contains one or more video sources. To specify a video
						   source, use either the src attribute or the < source > element; the
						   browser will choose the most suitable one.</p>
						
						<h2 id = "a135">< wbr ></h2>
						<p>The HTML element word break opportunity < wbr > represents a position
						   within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its
						   line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.
						
						   On UTF-8 encoded pages, < wbr > behaves like the U+200B ZERO-WIDTH SPACE
						   code point. In particular, it behaves like a Unicode bidi BN code point,
						   meaning it has no effect on bidi-ordering: < div dir=rtl>123,< wbr >456<
						   /div > displays, when not broken on two lines, 123,456 and not 456,123.
						
						   For the same reasoon, the <ï»¿wbrï»¿> element does not introduce a hyphen at
						   the line break point. To make a hyphen appear only at the end of a line,
						   use the soft hyphen character entity (&ï»¿shy;) instead.
						
						   This element was first implemented in Internet Explorer 5.5 and was
						   officially defined in HTML5.
