                        Since i was a little kid, my parents introduced me to the wonderful world of football,
                        that's because i'm a big fan of the sport, and i love to play it. I've played in amateur
                        teams since i was four years old and at this point, although i can't play it, 'cause a lung sickness,
                        i'm still a big fan, i like another sports too, but football for me is the greatest. Another things that
                        i like a lot, is play videogames, i haven't played them since too much time, but playing videogames it's
                        great :), another thing that i like too much is play the guitar an sign along, i really really enjoy music
                        and i like it a lot.

                        De grande quiero ser graffitera como Banksy. Me sé muchos nombres modelos pero hasta ahorita no me ha servido para nada.
