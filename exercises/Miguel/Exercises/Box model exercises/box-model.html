			<h3>Invictus</h3>
			<p>
				Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole tso pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

            <h3>Be or not to be</h3>
			<p>To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune, Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles, And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep No more; and by a sleep, to say we end The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. </p>

            <h3>Football</h3>
			<p>Football is the most important unimportant thing in the world</p>

            <h3>Football again</h3>
			<p>
Some argue that football has nothing to do with the life of man, with his most essential things. I do not know how much those people know about life. But of one thing I am certain: they know nothing about football</p>

            <h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
			<p>Hey. Don't ever let somebody tell you... You can't do something. Not even me. All right? You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it. Period.</p>
